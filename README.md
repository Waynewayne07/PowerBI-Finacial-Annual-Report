# ðŸ“ˆ Trends and Growth Strategy for a Financial Raising Company

## ðŸ§  Case Study Overview

This project analyses trends and strategic insights for a financial raising platform that specialises in small-cap and micro-cap companies. Since launching in 2020, the platform has grown rapidly, fuelled by retail investor demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a noticeable drop in investor participation since 2021 has prompted a deeper review of platform performance and future growth strategies.

## ðŸ§­ Analytical Framework

To structure the analysis and recommendations, the following strategy consulting tools were applied:

### 1. SCQ Framework
- **Situation**: The platform saw significant deal growth and popularity among retail investors since 2020.
- **Complication**: Despite an increase in deals, investor participation (number of bids and unique investors) declined from 2021 onward.
- **Question**: What are the root causes of the declining investor engagement, and what strategies will ensure sustainable growth and consistent deal quality?

### 2. Issue Tree
- Used to break down the main question into sub-issues related to:
  - Investor acquisition and retention
  - Deal quality and investor confidence
  - Platform UX and bid conversion
  - Market sentiment and competitor dynamics

This helped to **identify root causes** and map data sources for validation.

### 3. Impactâ€“Ease Matrix
- Potential strategies were plotted based on **impact** (on investor participation and platform performance) and **ease of execution**.
- High-impact, low-effort initiatives were prioritised to support short- to mid-term wins.
